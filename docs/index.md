## Overview

Welcome to the Node-RED documentation. Inevitably, we're still getting all of
the documentation into shape. Hopefully there is enough here to get you
started with Node-RED.

### More Nodes

There are lots of nodes that are not in the main core of Node-RED, some from the
project team and lots from contributors. We encourage contributors to [publish them via
NPM](creating-nodes/packaging.html) to make installation easy.

You can search the NPM repository for the [`node-red` keyword](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/node-red). 

### Other places to get help

If you have a question, suggestion or just want to say hello, there are various
places you can do so:

 - Subscribe to the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/node-red)
   and the [blog](http://blog.nodered.org)
 - Follow [@nodered](http://twitter.com/nodered) on Twitter
 - Chat on `#nodered` on `irc.freenode.net`

When reporting bugs or difficulties, please try to include the version number that
you are running. It can be found as almost the first line of debug in the console window. For example :

    01 Jan 12:00:00 - [red] Version: 0.9.1.git
